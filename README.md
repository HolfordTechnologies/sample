## Challenge Notes
This sample application combines Laravel, React and Tailwind to provide a minimal inventory management system, fulfilling requirements of Item creation, Item listing, and 1-M Comment association per Item. The application demonstrates Laravel controllers, data Models including basic Seeders, a single Laravel blade view and an embedded React application that provides clientside routing and dynamic functionality for additional views. Tailwind is implemented on both the Laravel blade template as well as the React components to provide a clean and balanced look.

Thanks for the opportunity to demonstrate my skills.
